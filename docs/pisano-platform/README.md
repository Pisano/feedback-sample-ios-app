# Pisano platform screenshots (reference)

Screenshots used in the main [README](../../README.md#pisano-platform-where-to-get-credentials) to show where to get SDK credentials in the Pisano panel. All labels and descriptions are in English.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create-mobile-app.png` | **Create Mobile Application** — dialog to enter application name and add bundle identifiers (iOS, Android). |
| `edit-mobile-app.png` | **Edit Mobile Application** — dialog to change application name and bundle identifiers. |
| `app-credentials.png` | **App card** — after creating an app, the card shows **App ID** and **Access Key** (with copy buttons) and the configured bundle identifiers. Use these in `Pisano.boot(appId:accessKey:...)`. |
| `publish-channel-params.png` | **Publish Channel Parameters** — after deploying a mobile channel, this modal shows **Code**, **Api Url**, and **Feedback Url** at the top. Use these for the new SDK (v1.0.17+). The legacy credentials section below is for the old structure. |

These images are referenced from the root README; keep paths in sync when renaming or moving files.
